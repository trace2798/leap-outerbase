# Integration Leap AI with Outerbase Command

### This repo is for my submission for the Outerbase X Hashnode hackathon, which took place during September 1 - September 30, 2023

#### Hashnode article: [Leap into the Future: Harnessing the Power of Outerbase and Leap AI](https://shreyas-chaliha.hashnode.dev/leap-into-the-future-harnessing-the-power-of-outerbase-and-leap-ai)
